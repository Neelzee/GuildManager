## Project

Uses `Java 17`

## Game Concept

Managing adventure parties, as a guild. Your responsibility, is handing out quests,
and taking a percentage off the rewards. Use your money to hire/attract higher level parties or invest into the guild.

Be careful, and don't hand out too difficult quests to parties.

You can assign magic items too different party members, and even manage their combat.
Or, if the quest/combat is super easy, auto-complete the encounter. (i.e. percentage chance of the quest failing).

## Game Idea

You play as an adventurous guild, that manages adventure parties that go out into the world, fight through dungeons,
monsters, escort missions and other similar adventures.

You can decide to auto-resolve events that happen during an adventure. The better the party,
the more likely the auto-resolve will succeed.

Adventurer stats work similar/same as DND stats
