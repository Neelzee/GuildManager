## Project

Uses `Java 17`

## Game Idea

You play as an adventurous guild, that manages adventure parties that go out into the world, fight through dungeons,
monsters, escort missions and other similar adventures.

You can decide to auto-resolve events that happen during an adventure. The better the party,
the more likely the auto-resolve will succeed.

Adventurer stats work similar/same as DND stats
